secondMessage = "Hi again sweetie!<br><br>I see you're still working hard at school. Here's a bit more: $1! Hopefully all this money doesn't make you complacent ;)<br><br>XOXO,<br>Mom"

thirdMessage = "Here's another $2, sweetie! I wish I could send more but Dad thinks you should try to work for a really good GPA... I suggested -500,000. Keep up the good work, and always remember that I'm proud of you!<br><br>XOXO,<br>Mom"

fourthMessage = "(don't tell Dad, but here's $5. I snuck to the mailbox while he wasn't looking. Okay, NOW I'm done sending money ;))<br><br>With sneakiness ;o,<br>Ninja-Mom"

fifthMessage = "Dearest child,<br><br>You've saved up a little bit of money, and this pleases me. I believe living frugally is one of the most honorable paths in life. For your dedication to a minimalist, non-wasteful life, I've bestowed upon you $0.03.<br><br>With greatest sincerity,<br>Father"

sixthMessage = "Hey roommate, I noticed you've been doing your homework a bunch, and pretty efficiently too... I've been having some trouble with mine. Mind doing some of my homework for me? I'll pay ya."

dadiqmessage = "Dearest child,<br><br>Thank you for improving your GPA so much. While I believe such a silly number has no real bearing on your value as a person (that would be IQ), it <i>does</i> get you scholarships that lower the cost of college, and also makes mother proud. I have enclosed my copy of <i>The Complete Works of Kant</i> and hope they prove enlightening. I've heard they're worth 1000 IQ points.<br><br>With greatest sincerity,<br>Father"

rickmessage = "Hey sport! Ol' Uncle Rick is in a bit of a tight spot and noticed your... whatever weird business you have going on at CU is quite profitable. I talked with your parents and they agreed that since they're paying for your education anyways, they'd be cool with me borrowing $150 from you. It's not like you need it or anything, you know? My brother went on his usual 'frugality' rant, but your momma is such a sweetheart and totally understood my situation.<br><br>Take care, sport!<br>Uncle Rick"

dadmoneymessage = "Dearest Child,<br><br>I see that in addition to living frugally you are also increasing your IQ at great speeds. This pleases me, for IQ is the ultimate number. I've given you $1. Cherish that dollar forever, my spawn.<br><br>With greatest sincerity,<br>Father"

roommateiqmessage = "Hey, so, uh... thanks for helping us all out... we thought that, as a show of thanks for doing all our homework and singlehandedly teaching us all our course material, we'd give you all our old textbooks as a gift! Yeah it's hard to resell them at a decent price because every class requires a new edition, haha. If the calculations you taught us how to do are right, these textbooks will give you a total of 2000 IQ points."

esportsmessage = "I've been watching you... heh, your IQ is pretty high. Almost high enough to be a gamer. Almost. I'll teach you the skills you need and get you connected to the right people to make it big in Esports if you become a Director in my club... wanna join? I'll give you $1 as an advance paycheck... consider it a discount on a pizza order... heh...<br><br>Call me,<br>EdgeIntersection"

mommessage = "Hi sweetie!<br><br>I see you've finally hit -500,000! You've worked so so hard, and I'm so so proud of you. I wouldn't blame you for stopping now to take a breather - I think you've earned it. But at this rate, I wouldn't be surprised if you got to 3.3 and became an Honor student soon! Then you could get into the Honors dorms, and it'd look good when applying for jobs, and I could finally put one of those 'Parent of an honor student' stickers on my car! Haha, just kidding on the last one ;) I don't want to embarrass you <i>too</i> much!!<br><br>XOXO,<br>Mom"

rick2message = "Hey sport! Gee, you're getting pretty smart... I could use some of that intelligence myself, ya know. Then I'd finally know how to invest the $150 I took from you! So that's why I broke into your dorm while you were sleeping and cut out half of your brain. I know, I know, it's a tad intrusive, but I think you'll get along just fine with the remaining half.<br><br>Keep studying, sport!<br>Uncle Rick"

hackwin = "Congratulations! You made it to a 3.3 GPA. I bet your parents are so pr-wait, what's this? You hacked into the school databases to win? Tsk tsk tsk, that's unethical. In spite of your astronomical IQ and funds, CU Boulder is always one step ahead and will promptly expel you, leaving you penniless and with no prospective jobs outside of a cashier position at Sprouts. This is the bad ending, you cheating scum."

realwin = "Congratulations! You made it to a 3.3 GPA. Through the help of clever investments, IQ-boosting activities, and, most of all, your friends and family, you've become an Honors student and made your mom very, very happy (and your grumpy dad, too!). Feel free to continue raising these numbers to absurd levels, or just press the 'Restart' button to try it all over again, or just stop playing this game entirely and do something more meaningful with your time. This is the good ending!"
